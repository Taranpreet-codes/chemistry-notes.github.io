## Unit of Hardness 
The hardness of water is typically measured in terms of the concentration of calcium and magnesium ions present in the water. The common units used to express water hardness are:

1. **Milligrams per Liter (mg/L)** or **Parts per Million (ppm)**:
   - This unit measures the concentration of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) equivalents in water.
   - 1 mg/L = 1 ppm.

2. **Grains per Gallon (gpg)**:
   - This unit is commonly used in the United States.
   - 1 gpg = 17.1 mg/L (or ppm) of calcium carbonate.

3. **Degrees of General Hardness (°GH) or German Degrees (°dH)**:
   - This unit is commonly used in Europe.
   - 1 °dH = 10 mg/L (or ppm) of calcium oxide (CaO) equivalent, which is approximately equal to 17.8 mg/L (or ppm) of calcium carbonate.

4. **Degrees of French Hardness (°fH or °f)**:
   - 1 °fH = 10 mg/L (or ppm) of calcium carbonate.

5. **Degrees of English Hardness (°e or °Clark)**:
   - 1 °e = 14.3 mg/L (or ppm) of calcium carbonate.

## Estimation of Hardness of Water

### using EDTA method 

The EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) titration method is a common analytical procedure used to estimate the hardness of water. This method relies on the formation of a complex between EDTA and the metal ions (calcium and magnesium) present in the water. Here is a step-by-step outline of the process:

### Materials Needed:
1. Water sample
2. EDTA solution (usually 0.01 M)
3. Eriochrome Black T indicator or another suitable metal ion indicator
4. Buffer solution (pH 10)
5. Burette, pipette, and conical flask

### Procedure:
1. **Preparation of the Sample**:
   - Measure 50 mL of the water sample using a pipette and transfer it into a conical flask.

2. **Addition of Buffer Solution**:
   - Add approximately 1-2 mL of the buffer solution to the conical flask to adjust the pH to around 10. This pH is optimal for the indicator to work effectively.

3. **Addition of Indicator**:
   - Add a few drops of Eriochrome Black T indicator to the water sample. The solution will turn wine red in the presence of calcium and magnesium ions.

4. **Titration with EDTA**:
   - Fill a burette with the standard EDTA solution.
   - Slowly titrate the water sample with the EDTA solution, while continuously swirling the flask.
   - As EDTA is added, it binds to the calcium and magnesium ions in the sample.
   - The endpoint of the titration is reached when the color of the solution changes from wine red to blue, indicating that all the metal ions have reacted with EDTA.

5. **Calculation**:
   - Note the volume of EDTA solution used to reach the endpoint.
   - Calculate the hardness of the water using the following formula:

     Hardness (mg/L as CaCO₃) = (Volume of EDTA (mL) × Molarity of EDTA × 50,000) / Volume of water sample (mL)


     Where:
     - Volume of EDTA is the volume used to reach the endpoint.
     - Molarity of EDTA is the concentration of the EDTA solution (e.g., 0.01 M).
     - 50,000 is a conversion factor to express the hardness in terms of mg/L of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃).

### Example Calculation:
- If 15 mL of 0.01 M EDTA is used to titrate 50 mL of the water sample:

Hardness = (15 × 0.01 × 50,000) / 50 = 150 mg/L as CaCO₃


This indicates that the water has a hardness of 150 mg/L as CaCO₃.

The EDTA titration method is widely used because it is accurate, relatively simple, and cost-effective for determining the hardness of water samples.
